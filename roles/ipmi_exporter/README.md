ipmi_exporter
=========

This Ansible role installs ipmi_exporter on target host. This is a Prometheus exporter for Intelligent Platform Management Interface [metrics](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ipmi_exporter/blob/master/docs/metrics.md)

Requirements
------------

By default, the exporter relies on tools from the FreeIPMI suite for the actual IPMI implementation.

Role Variables
--------------
Configuration files must have names ```web_conf.yaml``` and ```ipmi_local.conf```. If ipmi_exp_source_dir is specified, the role searches for ```web_conf.yaml``` and ```ipmi_local.conf``` in that directory and copy to target host in ```ipmi_exp_config_dir```. If the source directory is not specified, the role skips this step. In ipmi_local.conf user can describe what modules to use for metric collection.

ipmi_up{collector="<NAME>"} is 1 if the data for this collector could successfully be retrieved from the remote host, 0 otherwise. The following collectors are available and can be enabled or disabled in the config:
- ipmi: collects IPMI sensor data. If it fails, sensor metrics (see below) will not be available
- dcmi: collects DCMI data, currently only power consumption. If it fails, power consumption metrics (see below) will not be available
- bmc: collects BMC details. If it fails, BMC info metrics (see below) will not be available
- bmc-watchdog: collects status of the watchdog. If it fails, BMC watchdog metrics (see below) will not be available
- chassis: collects the current chassis power state (on/off). If it fails, the chassis power state metric (see below) will not be available
- sel: collects system event log (SEL) details. If it fails, SEL metrics (see below) will not be available
- sel-events: collects metrics for user-defined events in system event log (SEL). If it fails, SEL entries metrics (see below) will not be available
- sm-lan-mode: collects the "LAN mode" setting in the current BMC config. If it fails, the LAN mode metric (see below) will not be available
